# 🌐 Multilingual Voice & Text Translator with Emotion and ML Model Evaluation

This project is an advanced **Multilingual Translator Web Application** built using **Streamlit**, designed to help users translate voice or text between multiple languages in real time. It also includes **emotion analysis**, **sentiment scoring**, and **machine learning model evaluation** to enhance linguistic understanding and prediction accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔤 Multilingual Translation
- Translate between a wide variety of languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Tamil, French, Spanish, etc.)
- Supports both **text input** and **voice input (via microphone)**

### 🎙️ Voice Recognition
- Real-time speech-to-text using PyAudio and SpeechRecognition
- Automatically detect spoken language and transcribe it

### 💬 Text Sentiment & Emotion Analysis
- Uses **TextBlob** to analyze the sentiment of the translated text
- Calculates:
  - **Polarity** (positive to negative)
  - **Subjectivity** (factual to opinion-based)
  - Emotion labels (happy, sad, neutral)

### 📊 Machine Learning Model Evaluation
- Includes demos of:
  - **Clustering** (e.g., KMeans)
  - **Regression** (e.g., Linear Regression)
  - **Classification** (e.g., SVM or Logistic Regression)
- Outputs metrics like:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- Beautiful, interactive UI with animations and background effects
- Centered layout with animated buttons and toggles
- Fully responsive and user-friendly
